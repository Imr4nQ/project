- Public dataset licensed by Motivate International
- 12 CSVs merged into 1 dataset

---

# Cleaning & Preparation

- Removed empty columns, NA values, duplicates
- Calculated `ride_length` (in minutes)
- Created `day_of_week` using `wday()` from lubridate
- Removed rows with negative ride lengths
- Verified consistency across all months

# Summary Statistics

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)

bike_data <- read_csv("cyclistic_tripdata_cleaned.csv")

bike_data <- bike_data %>%
  mutate(ride_length = as.numeric(difftime(ended_at, started_at, units = "mins")),
         day_of_week = wday(started_at, label = TRUE)) %>%
  filter(ride_length > 0)

bike_data %>%
  group_by(member_casual) %>%
  summarise(
    avg_ride = round(mean(ride_length),1),
    median_ride = round(median(ride_length),1),
    max_ride = round(max(ride_length),1),
    number_of_rides = n()
  )


#Rides by Day of Week

bike_data %>%
  group_by(member_casual, day_of_week) %>%
  summarise(number_of_rides = n()) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = day_of_week, y = number_of_rides, fill = member_casual)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "Number of Rides by Rider Type & Day",
       x = "Day of Week", y = "Number of Rides")

# Average Ride Duration by Day

bike_data %>%
  group_by(member_casual, day_of_week) %>%
  summarise(avg_duration = mean(ride_length)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = day_of_week, y = avg_duration, fill = member_casual)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "Avg Ride Duration by Rider Type & Day",
       x = "Day of Week", y = "Duration (minutes)")
```

# Key Insights

- Casual riders take longer rides, especially on weekends
- Members take shorter, more frequent rides, mostly on weekdays
- Suggests: casual = leisure, members = commuters
